## 1. Project Title
**Teacher Portfolio DApp - NFT Showcase**

## 2. Project Description
The Teacher Portfolio DApp is a blockchain-based application built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts. It allows minting NFTs that represent teacher achievements, awards, and impacts. Each NFT stores important details such as the teacher's name, achievement title, and an impact score to highlight their contributions to education.

## 3. Project Vision
The vision of this project is to create a decentralized, tamper-proof portfolio system for teachers, where achievements are permanently recorded on the blockchain. This ensures transparency, credibility, and easy access to verified records of their professional impact.

## 4. Future Scope
- Integration with a front-end to display NFT portfolios visually.
- Adding multimedia support (images, certificates) linked to NFTs.
- Implementing a rating/review system from students and peers.
- Providing analytics on teacher performance and growth over time.
- Enabling cross-platform verification for educational institutions.
